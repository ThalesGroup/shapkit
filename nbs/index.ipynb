    "Machine Learning is enjoying an increasing success in many applications: medical, marketing, defense, cyber security, transport. It is becoming a key tool in critical systems. However, models are often very complex and highly non-linear. This is problematic, especially for critical systems, because end-users need to fully understand decisions of an algorithm (e.g. why an alert has been triggered, why a person has a high probability of cancer recurrence,. . . ). One solution is to offer an interpretation for each individual prediction based on attribute relevance. Shapley Values allow to distribute fairly contributions for each attribute in order to understand the difference between a predicted value for an observation and a base value (e.g. the average prediction of a reference population).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used is:\n",
    "* **agnostic**: no particular information on the model is needed, it works with black box algorithms. We only define a reward funtion (e.g. the model output).\n",
    "* **local**: the explanation is computed at instance level. Thus, each interpretation is associated to a given prediction.\n",
    "* More suitable for **tabular data** with meaningful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A concrete use case: COMPAS\n",
    "\n",
    "> *COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendantâ€™s likelihood of reoffending (recidivism)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have trained a machine learning model to predict the probability of recividism of a given individual. The algorithm is quite effective but it only returns a probability score without any details on how it has made its choice.\n",
    "We would like to know how each attribute (characteristic) influences the model output. Furthermore, contributions explain the difference between the individual prediction and the mean prediction for all references. These references are defined by the user (e.g. for classification, interesting references are selected into other predicted classes)."
